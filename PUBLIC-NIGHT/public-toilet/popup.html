        <p>Cities and their municipal administrators have been shifting from focusing on public infrastructure for the
          needs and wellbeing of their citizens to becoming business-like entities striving for economic growth. This
          results in a global contest between cities regarding their attractiveness. This development has been going on
          since the 1980s and has us questioning who has a
          right to the
          city <small>(Eick 1998; Heeg and Rosol 2007)</small>. In the
          wake of this attractiveness contest, public toilets can become a marketing tool for cities.</p>

        <p> Increasingly, city centers and neighboring spaces are supposed to be cities’ visiting cards <small>(Heeg and
            Rosol
            2007)</small>. The motivation for municipalities to build and renovate public toilets in these areas is
          often to
          attract and retain tourists and other economically beneficial visitors there <small>(Lowe 2018)</small>. In
          her comprehensive
          book <span class="bold">“No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs”</span> (2018), Canadian journalist Lezlie Lowe
          describes how communities in British Columbia, the city of Denver and the small town of Lunenburg in Nova
          Scotia all prioritized public toilets to promote tourism in her comprehensive book.
          Even though these toilets seem to be aimed at visitors, Lowe highlights that local residents also benefit from
          the public toilets installation, especially if adaptations are made, like extensions to the opening times into
          the off season, as for example happened in Lunenburg. However, one has to consider that their design, their
          location, their opening times regarding time of day and season, remain dependent on changing governments and
          businesses interests. <small>(Lowe 2018; Heeg and Rosol 2007)</small></p>

        <p> Apart from the goal of attracting and retaining visitors and businesses, another factor motivating
          municipalities and businesses to build public toilets is evident in marketing campaigns accompanying some
          construction and renovation projects. This factor seems to aim either at promoting diversity or the purported
          welfare state goals of the current government or around promoting a certain image regarding the culture of the
          city, region or the culture of the respective country <small>(Lowe 2018; The Tokyo Toilet Project,
            n.d.)</small>. For this,
          the architecture of the toilets, artworks in the establishments, or artworks that are specifically produced to
          support these marketing campaigns are used to spread these projects on a national or even global scale. The
          toilets become sites of representation.</p>

        <p>A recent example for representative public toilets is <span class="bold">“The Tokyo Toilet”</span> project. Seventeen public toilets
          have been reimagined in Shibuya, the downtown district of Tokyo, since 2020 <small>(The Tokyo Toilet Project,
            n.d.)</small>.
          The Shibuya Municipal Government, the Nippon Foundation, a non-governmental organization that manages the
          proceeds from Japanese motorboat races <span class="bold">"for philanthropic purposes"</span>, the Japanese construction companies
          Daiwo House and TOTO, and the Shibuya City Tourism Association worked together to implement and continuously
          maintain and manage the project.</p>

        <p> The opinion piece by Jungo Kanayama, the Representative Director of the Shibuya City Tourism Association,,
          which is uploaded on the <span class="bold">“The Tokyo Toilets”</span> Website, reads like a positive turn on Susanne Heegs and Marit
          Rosols paragraph on <span class="bold">“Territorial Control Strategies”</span> in <span class="bold">“neoliberal city-politics in the global context”</span>
          (2007), starting with describing Shibuya as <span class="bold">“a theme park”</span> for visitors. For him, the toilets seem to fulfill
          the function of making visitors' trip experiences better in providing quality toilets while simultaneously
          representing <span class="bold">“Shibuya Cities [our city’s] uniqueness and character”</span>.</p>

        <p> The representational factor also seems to have played a role in motivating the toilets for government
          agencies, with Shibuya district mayor Ken Hasebe stating on the project's website that he hoped the toilets,
          like Shibuya's fashion and music, would send a message on a national and global scale..</p>

        <p> And it seems to work: The toilets were designed by famous architects, including four of the nine Pritzker
          Prize winners from Japan (Tadao Andō, Toyo Ito, Shigeru Ban, Fumihiko Maki). For their famous designers, as
          well as for their representative and unique architecture, the toilets were featured in several international
          (architecture) magazines and newspapers like The Spaces, designboom, The Guardian, The Telegraph and Dezeen
          <small>(Tucker 2020; Barandy 2021; McCurry 2020; Ryall 2023; Ravenscroft 2020)</small>.
          Additionally, German film-maker Wim Wenders directed the film “Perfect Days” revolving around the toilets,
          depicting the life of Hirayama, a fictional member of the cleaning staff <small>(Wenders 2023)</small>. The
          movie was
          nominated for the Academy Awards and the actor who played Hirayama won the Palme D'Or, so naturally the motion
          picture drew wide international attention <small>(The Economist 2023)</small>.
        </p>

        <p> Ultimately, one keeps wondering if “The Tokyo Toilet” project highlighted the general importance of quality
          public toilets locally and globally, or if it simply sought to bring attention to Shibuya as an
          architecturally and/or culturally interesting tourist attraction. Were the toilets constructed to represent
          Japan’s “hospitality culture”<small>(The Tokyo Toilet Project, n.d.)</small> and “higher standard of hygiene”
          <small>(‘THE TOKYO
            TOILET’, n.d.)</small> or to provide more and better provision of public toilets to Tokyo’s residents? When
          do these
          buildings become more monuments than toilets? In replacing existing structures, provision in number didn’t
          increase. However, according to the project's website they increased the provision of more accessible toilets.
          Besides accessibility, do locals actually benefit from the architectural diversity? What will the effects of
          the representative factor of these “little jewels” <small>(Wim Wenders, 2024)</small> on gentrification and
          displacement in
          their neighborhoods be?
