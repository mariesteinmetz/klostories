        <p>The Parisian <span class="bold">“Vespasienne”</span> and the <span class="bold">“Café Achteck”</span> from Berlin, both found in this world, are public urinals
          designed to be used in a standing position. They were manufactured in series and installed in the 19th century
          in their respective cities. In a time of the separate spheres ideology, they allowed abled body men to spend
          more time in public, but left especially women on a so-called <span class="bold">“bladder leash”</span> closely around their home
          <small>(Lowe
            2018, 29,57; Ramster, Greed, and Bichard 2018, 98)</small>. At the turn of the century Paris represented the
          pinnacle
          of urinal provision with 4000 Vespasiennes <small>(Furrer 2010, 68; Richter 2020, 49)</small>.
        </p>

        <p> Some of these urinals from the turn of the century still exist today and in many cases uphold a higher
          provision for people able to pee in a standing position. Additionally some cities even constructed new urinals
          that are only possible to use in a standing position <small>(Greed 2003, 105; Ramster, Greed, and Bichard
            2018,
            96;
            Schubert 2020; Grönwall and Winker 2010)</small>. Since the 19th century construction has been primarily
          aimed
          at
          drunk men <small>(Ramster, Greed, and Bichard 2018, 97)</small>. These developments can also be observed in
          many
          other
          European cities <small>(Ramster, Greed, and Bichard 2018, 97; Furrer 2010, 68; Richter 2020, 49)</small>.
          Architectural
          historian and toilet activist Clara Greed even reports contrary developments, where <span class="bold">“many traditional day-time
            city center toilets which met the day-time and evening needs of the general public, providing facilities for
            women and men, and for the disabled too, are being closed.”</span><small>(Greed 2003, 105)</small>. To her this means
          an even bigger
          privilege for abled men through the shifting of resources <span class="bold">"to meet the night-time needs of drinkers”</span>
          <small>(Greed
            2003, 105)</small>.
        </p>
        <p>In 2019 the dutch 19th century urinals lovingly called <span class="bold">“plaskrul”</span> (“pisscurl”) caused nation-wide protests
          after a woman was prosecuted in Amsterdam for peeing right next to one <small>(Boffey 2017; Richter 2020,
            49)</small>.
          <span class="bold">“Amsterdam has 35 public urinals for men and only three public toilets for women. It was past the closing time
            of local bars, and Piening [the women prosecuted] was a couple of kilometers from the nearest women’s toilet
            facilities."</span> The Guardian reported before the protests of the sparse provision in Amsterdam for people unable
          to urinate in a standing position began.
        </p>
        <p>When I was sketching inside a Café Achteck in Berlin recently, a woman entered the octagon. I left to give
          her
          some privacy peeing. When she came out and I went back in to continue sketching the architecture, you could
          see the impracticality of the urinal for people peeing squatting. Her pee puddle was in the middle of the
          octagonal space, not at the sides as intended. The splashback was visible and seemingly her feet must have
          gotten a good amount of urine on them, because I could trace her wet foot steps out of the urinal. The judge
          who sparked the protest in Amsterdam claimed about urinating with a vulva in a standing urinal: <span class="bold">"It would not
            be pleasant but it can be done."</span> <small>(Boffey 2017)</small>.</p>
