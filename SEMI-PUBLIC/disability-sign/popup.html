        <p>In this museum, like in many other public buildings, toilets for able-bodied people are segregated into two
          rooms. One for women and one for men. And then there is often a third room: the disabled toilet. This room is
          supposed to provide equal access in the built environment for disabled people. Simultaneously, it is in many
          cases the only room that is not assigned to a specific gender.</p>

        <p>
          <b>“With this [spatial separation of the disabled toilet] they [disabled people] are not only
            constructionally
            marked as an exception, but also labeled as an outlier through the signposting as “”disabled toilet” or
            “accessible toilet”.”</b><small>(Autor*innenkollektiv Rosa Loo 2023)</small>
        </p>

        <p> The structural separation of the disabled toilet, by being in a separate room, to the mens and womens
          toilet,
          as well as the disabled toilet being, in contrast to the mens and womens toilet, gender-neutral, are forms of
          Othering (exclusion, negative highlighting of differences) of disabled people <small>(Mélina Germes 2021, 40;
            Autor*innenkollektiv Rosa Loo 2023, 87)</small>.</p>

        <p>However PISSAR (People in Search of Safe and Accessible Restrooms) an initiative formed by students, staff
          and
          community members at the University of California in Santa Barbara in 2003 recognized a potential in the
          gender neutrality of the disabled toilet to create alliances between queer activists and disability activists
          on campus.
          Instead of demanding the inclusion of the disabled toilet in the <b>“norm”</b> of gendered segregation, they saw the
          disabled toilet as a starting point for the fight for inclusion in toilet access for both disabled and
          genderqueer people <small>(Chess et al. 2008)</small>.</p>

        <p>While queer people are threatened by <b>“violence and harassment”</b><small>(Chess et al. 2008, 217)</small> in
          gendered restrooms
          if their appearance does not fit into the binary gender <b>“ideals”</b> of the mens and womens toilets, disabled
          toilets still primarily consider the needs of wheelchair users, and people with visual and hearing
          impairments, not regarding people falling into an extended understanding of disability including for example
          people with chronic pain, mental illness or people that are severely disabled <small>(Mélina Germes 2021;
            klo:lektiv
            2021; Stiftung Leben Pur, n.d.)</small>. Furthermore PISSAR notes that some legally required disabled
          restrooms are
          not even sufficiently complying with the local national norm the Americans with Disability Act <small>(Chess
            et al.
            2008, 217)</small>.</p>

        <p> Fighting the two struggles for better and more provision separately, in applying the existing <b>“norm”</b> of
          gendered segregation to the disabled toilet as Alison Kafer, who is part of PISSAR, underlines in her book
          <b>“Feminist, Queer, Crip”</b>, would <b>“overlook the reality that some disabled people are also, simultaneously, trans
            and genderqueer people [...]”</b>, therefore segregation by gender would create even more marginalization
          <small>(Kafer
            2013, 156)</small>.
        </p>

        <p><b>“[...],how might a nongendered toilet policy transform the way that we talk about gender and disability,
            recognizing that the use value of public toilets is often defined and delimited by the historical legacies
            of
            heterosexual male privileges within public space?”</b><small>(David Serlin 2010, 181)</small></p>

        <p> In their activist fieldwork PISSAR realized that there are several other groups that similarly don’t hold
          any
          what they call <b>“pee-privilege”</b>: The certainty that standardized restroom design will accommodate their needs.
          This led them to include menstruation and childcare issues into their activist work. Other researchers had the
          same experience, David Serlin highlights Clara Greed's work on the benefits of disabled toilet design for
          people <b>“who do not identify as disabled”</b> such as <b>“ the elderly, temporarily disabled, large-sized people,
            [...] parents pushing strollers”</b> and travelers <small>(David Serlin 2010)</small>. The german writing
          collective Rosa Loo
          highlights as well that the gender segregated toilet for able-bodied people would also not consider people not
          falling into the <b>“norm range”</b> of the Body-Mass-Index, whereas disabled toilets usually provide enough space
          for them <small>(Autor*innenkollektiv Rosa Loo 2023)</small>.</p>

        <p> The work of these activists and other initiatives, according to the German Klo:lektiv, would represent a
          change in perspective from physical deficiency to the inadequacy of spatial design. Or in terms of <b>“disability
            studies scholars and disability activists”</b> would define <b>“disability”</b> as a <b>“product of social relations”</b> and
          not as a medical problem that can be fixed or managed on an individual basis, according to Alison Kafer.
          Disability would therefore be a problem in <b>“built environment and social patterns that exclude or stigmatize”</b>.
          The same thing applies to gender nonconforming people: the gender segregated toilet is a result of a social
          construct and people who do not conform to the gendered norm, either by choice or unwillingly, are not the
          problem but the spatial design excluding them is. The future lies in intersectional toilet design, because
          people can be old and gender nonconforming, disabled and gender nonconforming, disabled and menstruating,
          menstruating and gender nonconforming, gender nonconforming, menstruating and traveling with children… and all
          of these people rely on sufficient and safe toilet provision to participate in public life.</p>
