        <p>why is there a line infront of the womens restroom?</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>To the question <b>“Why is there such a long line in front of the women's restroom?”</b> the answers lie in a
          phenomenon called <b>“fixture inequity”</b><small>(Rawls 1988)</small>. <b>“Fixture inequity”</b> results from inequality in
          the built
          environment and cultural as well as biological factors:</p>
        <ul>
          People using stalls in the women's restroom need the toilet longer and more frequently due to biological
          and
          cultural reasons.
          <ul>
            <li>biological reasons being that if they have a uterus they are more likely to menstruate, be pregnant or
              to
              develop a urinary tract infection or incontinence <small>(Deutsche Kontinenz Gesellschaft 2011; Deltourbe
                et al.
                2022)</small></li>
            <li>cultural reasons being also that if they have a vulva and wear trousers they take more time to undress,
              or
              that they are more likely to care for elderly people or children <small>(Lowe 2018)</small></li>
          </ul>


          Reasons related to the built environment are
          <ul>
            <li>There is equal floor space assigned to the mens and the womens toilets, which results in more provision
              of
              toilets in mens restroom due to the usage of men's urinals, which are more space efficient than standard
              water
              closets <small>(Ghent University 2017)</small>.</li>
            <li> There is an equal number in toilets in both mens and womens restrooms but women still need longer and
              once
              cues have formed they take a long time to dissolve <small>(Ghent University 2017)</small>.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>One solution to this inequality could be a movement called <b>“potty parity"</b>. “Potty parity” strives for a ratio
          of
          distribution in favor of women's toilets, meaning more toilets in the women's restroom than in the mens
          restroom. According to Lezlie Lowe, a Canadian journalist and public toilet advocate, “potty parity”
          legislation
          has been passed at some municipal and state levels in the US and at national level in Canada <small>(Lowe
            2018)</small>. On
          the
          contrary, in some countries, like Germany, building codes still favor men’s toilets in provision
          <small>(Bundesanstalt
            für Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitsmedizin 2013)</small>.
        </p>
        <p> A better solution to <b>“eliminate waiting times”</b>, could be unisex toilets, according to Ghent University
          researchers who specialize in queuing. Besides providing a safer environment for gender-non conforming people,
          unisex stalls and optionally additional urinals, would reduce average waiting times, <b>“ As sharing the toilet
            capacity across sexes is more efficient [...]. The available toilet surface can be used most efficiently when
            an
            ideally balanced layout with about two cabins per urinal is chosen.”</b><small>(Ghent University 2017)</small>.
          People able to
          pee
          in a standing position would still wait less, but the difference in waiting times would be much smaller
          <small>(Ghent
            University 2017)</small>.
        </p>

        <p>However questions of eliminating gender segregation completely are sometimes refrained from in the <b>“potty
          parity”</b> movement, due to some women seeing the restroom as their safe space from men, especially for religious
          reasons <small>(Lowe 2018; Kern 2020)</small>. Sadly this debate is often escalated with transphobic arguments
          to which Leslie
          Kern author of “Feminist City” responds that: <b>“If cis-men actually had to spend enough time getting into drag
            that they passed as women in order to sexually assault women, I suspect there would be a lot less sexual
            assault. [...] I think the fear of “fake” trans women is rooted purely in transphobia, and not in any actual
            concern for the real violence that women—trans and cis—experience regularly.”</b><small>(Kern 2020, 120)</small>.
