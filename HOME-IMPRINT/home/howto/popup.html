        <p>In this toilet universe you will get the possibility to travel through 4 different worlds: the private, semi-private, semi-public and finally the public world.</p>

        <p>Inside all the worlds, you can use your mouse and hover around the screen, to find out what elements hide some interesting information and stories on toilets, that will be revealed once you click on it. </p>

        <p>The names already reveal alot, but let's get some clarifications on the world. </p>
        
        <p>The <span class="bold">private </span> world is the most intimate one. It is the space that, in everyday life, you’ll only get access to if directly invited by the owner of the space. (If not, you might have overstepped some boundaries… and even risk punishment). </p>

        <p>The <span class="bold">semi-private</span> world stands for the spaces that seem to be accessible to most of us when in public, but in fact belong to private hands. They are given the power to prohibit access to chosen people, via asking for monetary exchange for example or just refusing entry.</p>

        <p>The <span class="bold">semi-public</span> world represents the spaces that belong to public authorities and therefore, one should think, are accessible to all. Schools, libraries, municipal swimming pools, etc. Although they belong to public property, access is still not guaranteed at all times in such spaces. </p>

        <p>Finally the <span class="bold">public</span> space, it speaks for itself. It is the space that is accessible to all (but still not at any time, if we think about public parks), where no restrictions should exist and one can move and pee around freely. </p>

        <p>To enable you to travel through the different worlds, every world is identified through an element that can be found in all the other worlds. By clicking on it, you will be transported to the world it is linked to. </p>

        <p>Window = private</p>
        <p> clock = semi-private </p>
        <p>museum poster = semi-public </p>
        <p>mountains = public</p> 


      

        <p>Now you should be ready to explore the universe on your own without getting too lost in it. 
        </p>

        <p class="bold">Enjoy the flush! </p>
