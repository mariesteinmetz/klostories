        <p><span class="bold">“Capitalism was a system of many social divisions, yet all people experienced equally the need to defecate. How capitalist societies dealt with this basic need exposed the deep tensions this system created between public and private, exploiter and exploited, masculine and feminine, and black and white”</span> <span class="sources">(Art for a Democratic Society 2017)</span> </p> 

        <p>This seems to be quite a good definition of how capitalism affects our bodies and needs, written by the artist collective Art for a Democratic Society. Although at first slightly intriguing, it is on purpose that they chose the past tense to <span class="bold">“infuse a sense of hope: that this system will one day be a thing of the past, that we can and will build a more equitable world”</span><span class="sources">(ibid.)</span>. I strongly wish so! </p>

        <p>In 2017, the collective created an exhibition for the Museum of Capitalism in Oakland, where they used <span class="bold">“bathroom breaks</span>” as items to explore <span class="bold">“bathroom breaks</span> of people during their work time. <span class="sources">(ibid)</span>. </p>

       <p>No wonder another word for bathroom is the word restroom, a place where you get <span class="bold">“some private time away from your employers and your work”</span> <span class="sources">(ibid.)</span>. Indeed, the capitalist system is based on a never-ending control of the workplace and the workers through severe and strict time management, leaving little space for fundamental biological and psychological human needs. <span class="bold">“It is therefore unsurprising that under capitalism defecation and urination were also sites of class struggle”</span><span class="sources">(ibid.)</span>.</p> 

       <p>Law professor Marc Linder and urogynecologist Ingrid Nygaardretrace the long history of the worker’s struggle for the right to pee on the job (1998). They describe how, in 1995, female assembly line workers at a Nabisco factory in Oxnard were forced to wear diapers at their workplace because their supervisors did not give them enough bathroom breaks. Those who did not have the money to buy diapers wore period pads or toilet paper which, if soaked with urine, pose severe health risks such as bladder infections or worse, urinary tract infections. Fortunately, workers took matters into their own hands and filed a lawsuit for their right to pee at work. <span class="sources">(Robin 2012)</span></p>

       <p>From the beginning of industrialisation until today, bathroom breaks and biological needs are seen by the capitalist as <span class="bold">“efficiency”</span> problems that need to be solved. In assembly line factories, taylorist “time studies” were undertaken to cut down production to the most basic tasks. Lunch breaks, bathroom breaks and all other breaks were timed to reduce them to the bare minimum. Workers who did not adhere to these strict boundaries were fired by the managers or charged with a fine. Workers with bowel conditions would face significant wage cuts. <span class="sources">(Art for a Democratic Society 2019)</span></p>

       <p>In the US, during the 20th and 21st centuries, one of the most famous industries for denying workers their right to bathroom breaks was the poultry industry. Workers came together in workers unions, to resist and fight for their rights. One of the unions organised a so-called “pee-in” to fight against a policy that would give them the right to use the restroom only during strictly scheduled breaks. Workers would drink a big amount of water in the morning at the beginning of work, making the queue during the 15-minute breaks so long that not all of the workers were able to use the facilities. Through this resistance, they won  the right to use the bathroom at any time during work. <span class="sources">(Art for a Democratic Society 2019)</span></p>

       <p>One could think that the situation would have evolved. But still today the <span class="bold">“workplace can sometimes seem like a battlefield of the bladder”</span> <span class="sources">(Robin 2012)</span>. Indeed, numerous examples show that workers all around the world still don't get the right to pee on the job when they need to. To only name a few: Amazon workers pee into empty plastic bottles. <span class="sources">(<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z348y9/amazon-drivers-are-still-peeing-in-bottles" target="_blank">Roscoe 2022</a>)</span> Amazon even recognises this, <span class="sources">(<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-drivers-peeing-in-bottles-union-vote-worker-complaints/" target="_blank">Picchi 2021</a>)</span> but not much has changed. Truck drivers pee into bottles, they even have a term for this: trucker bombs <span class="sources">(‘Urban Dictionary: Trucker Bomb’, n.d.)</span>. Taxi drivers in NYC, have no designated places to go and relieve themselves while on the job <span class="sources">(Molotch and Norén 2010, 93)</span>. And many more…</p>

       <p>Capitalism promises freedom, but it continues to give the power to the capitalists to suppress the workers in their vulnerable situation by depriving them of their most basic human needs. People in already less privileged situations are the ones that end up being the most affected.</p>

       <p>So let’s <span class="bold">pee for our rights</span>. </p>
