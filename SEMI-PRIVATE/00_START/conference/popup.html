        <p><span class="bold">“I argue with passion that public toilets are essential for creating accessible, sustainable and equal cities [...].”</span> <span class="sources"> (Greed 2003)</span></p> 

        <p>In the mid-19th century, governments in Central European countries operated under welfare states, focusing on providing local services, facilities and benefits to citizens. At that time, due to a lack of private sanitation in most homes, public defecation was common. However, as urbanisation intensified with industrialisation and urban density grew, human waste in public spaces became a health hazard, contributing to diseases like cholera. In response, governments began developing sanitary systems, including the provision of free public toilets, to mitigate these health risks. <span class="sources">(cf. Damon 2023; Kuhn et al., n.d.)</span></p>

        <p>By the 1980’s, the shift towards capitalism and liberal governance altered the landscape of cities, leading to what urban theorist David Harvey termed the <span class="bold">“entrepreneurial city”</span> <span class="sources">(Harvey 1989; Heeg and Rosol 2007; Schipper and Duveneck 2012)</span>. Cities began competing globally for attractiveness and economic growth, resulting in an <span class="bold">“economisation of urban development”</span> <span class="sources">(Schipper and Duveneck 2012)</span> with municipal administrators becoming <span class="bold">“managers of a business location rather than administrators of a community”</span> <span class="sources">(Eick 1998)</span> </p>

        <p>Cities having to keep up with the competitiveness, they increasingly enter into Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), transferring responsibilities for public spaces and infrastructure to private companies with more financial power to invest. One example would be the French advertising company JCDecaux, with which many cities have entered in PPPs. <span class="bold">“JCDecaux’s DNA is to provide innovative solutions for city and transport infrastructure at no cost for the taxpayer”</span> <span class="sources">(JCDecaux Group 2019)</span> In many cities worldwide, the company has taken over the financial and logistic responsibility for implementing public toilet infrastructure. In return, the cities offer JCDecaux free advertising space and the economisation of one of our most basic bodily needs. 
        </p>

        <p>However, such partnerships raise concerns. They shift political responsibilities from elected governmental bodies to non-governmental and non-elected entities driven primarily by profit motives rather than community well-being. In many Western cities, private alliances exert increasing control over urban spaces, transforming city centres into consumption hubs and all disturbing and irritating factors to the consumer that are <span class="bold">“not compatible with the idea of an upgraded shopping and recreation area”</span><span class="sources">(Heeg and Rosol 2007)</span> are being hidden, displaced and excluded. </p>

        <p>Despite their importance, municipalities are not mandated to provide public toilets <span class="sources">(Smets 2007; Kuhn et al., n.d.)</span>. While being a public space serving our most basic human needs, they are still wrongly met with feelings of disgust and apprehension. Linked to social problems such as drug use, sexual practices, vandalism, occupation by unhoused people and many more, most municipalities prefer shutting them down, evicting the unwanted out of sight rather than investing in adequate infrastructures for all. </p>

        <p>This neglect not only affects marginalised and vulnerable populations who rely on city centres for survival,  it also undermines the inclusivity and accessibility that cities should embody for all residents. </p>

        <p>Therefore, echoing Clara Greed’s call for action, <span class="bold">“We need a restroom revolution”</span> <span class="sources">(Greed 2003)</span> to make our cities welcoming and accessible to all.</p>
