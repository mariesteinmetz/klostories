        <p><span class="bold">“You have a right to the city. But it’s hard to participate in public life when there’s nowhere to use the bathroom. You shouldn’t have to pay to take care of your basic needs!”</span> <span class="sources">(‘BATHROOM CODES’, n.d.)</span></p> 

        <p>In France and Germany, it is the municipalities that are responsible for providing public toilets. However, there are no legal mandates requiring these facilities, so many municipalities are hesitant to invest in them. <span class="sources">(Smets 2007; Kuhn et al., n.d.)</span> Indeed, the construction and installation of public toilets costs around 130.000€ with additional yearly maintenance costs ranging from 20.000€ to 40.000€ for two toilet cubicles. (Smets 2007; ‘Die nette Toilette’, n.d.) This reluctance results in a significant lack of accessible and free sanitary facilities for the public. </p>
