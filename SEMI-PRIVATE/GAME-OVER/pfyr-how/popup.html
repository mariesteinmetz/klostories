        <p><span class="bold">“You have a right to the city. But it’s hard to participate in public life when there’s nowhere to use the bathroom. You shouldn’t have to pay to take care of your basic needs!”</span> <span class="sources">(‘BATHROOM CODES’, n.d.)</span></p> 

        <p>In France and Germany, it is the municipalities that are responsible for providing public toilets. However, there are no legal mandates requiring these facilities, so many municipalities are hesitant to invest in them. <span class="sources">(Smets 2007; Kuhn et al., n.d.)</span> Indeed, the construction and installation of public toilets costs around 130.000€ with additional yearly maintenance costs ranging from 20.000€ to 40.000€ for two toilet cubicles. <span class="sources">(Smets 2007; ‘Die nette Toilette’, n.d.)</span> This reluctance results in a significant lack of accessible and free sanitary facilities for the public. </p>

        <p>When in need, people often turn to nearby establishments like cafés, bars, restaurants, bakeries, and shops, only to be refused access. Legally, these are private spaces open to the public, and owners <span class="bold">“have the power and the right to exclude others from access to what is assigned to them by right”</span>. <span class="sources">(Nuss 2020)</span> For instance, in France, such establishments are only required to provide toilets <span class="bold">“for the exclusive use of customers”</span> <span class="italic-bold">“à l’usage exclusif de la clientèle”</span>. <span class="sources">(arrêt du 09 mai 1995, article 21)</span> This lack of free public sanitation makes it difficult for people to exercise their right to the city, as they are denied their most basic needs. <span class="bold">“We live in a world, after all, where the rights of private property and the profit rate trump all other notions of rights one can think of”</span> <span class="sources">(Harvey 2008)</span> </p>

        <p>Henri Smets, a French engineer, addresses the issue of accessible sanitation in France. 
        He notes that Paris has only 750 public toilet facilities for a population of 2.197 million, resulting in 2.929 inhabitants per facility. This is clearly insufficient. 
        Smets estimates the total number of toilets across France as follows: 
        </p>

        <p class="numbers">
          <p class="numbers">42 million <span class="space1"></span> at home (with 35 million habitations)</p>

          <p class="numbers">3 million <span class="space2"></span> in companies (with 1.1 million companies)</p>

          <p class="numbers">1 million <span class="space3"></span> in schools (with 61.000 schools)</p>

          <p class="numbers">600.000 <span class="space4"></span> in administrative buildings </p>

          <p class="numbers">100.000 <span class="space5"></span> in town halls </p>

          <p class="numbers">70.000 <span class="space6"></span> in restauration establishments</p>

          <p class="numbers">62.000 <span class="space7"></span> in super- and hypermarkets</p>

          <p class="numbers">3.200 <span class="space8"></span> in shopping-malls </p>

          <p class="numbers">14.000 <span class="space9"></span> public toilets</p>
          
          <p class="numbers">Approximative total <span class="space10"></span> = 46,85 million toilets</p></p>

          <p>This approximates to a total of 46.85 million toilets for a population of 67.92 million, theoretically providing one toilet for every 1.5 people. These numbers raise the question: why can’t we culturally rethink our approach to toilet access? How can we better utilise the extensive existing infrastructure to ensure free accessibility? 
          First initiatives have been taken in different countries. 
          </p>

          <p>In New York City, the facility mag community has an ongoing project to collect and share bathroom codes from establishments, allowing people in need to access semi-private facilities until the municipality addresses this issue. <span class="sources">(‘BATHROOM CODES’, n.d.)</span></p>

          <p>In the UK, individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), like Crohn’s and Colitis or IBS, can obtain a <span class="bold">“Can’t wait Card”</span>, granting them free access to facilities in various establishments. <span class="sources">(‘Can’t Wait Card’, n.d.; ‘Just Can’t Wait Cards from Bladder & Bowel UK - Bladder & Bowel UK’ 2019; ‘Can’t Wait Card | The IBS Network’, n.d.)</span> 
          Similarly, Illinois has the Restroom Access Act, which gives people with eligible medical conditions the right to use toilets whenever needed. <span class="sources">(Smets 2007)</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>In Germany,in 1986, the so-called <span class="bold">“Euro-WC-Schlüssel”</span> was founded. A standard key that grants physically disabled people independently access to disabled sanitary facilities in, for example, motorway and railway station toilets, but also public toilets in pedestrian zones, museums and public authorities. People with an IBD condition are also eligible to participate. Meanwhile a total of around 12.000 public toilets throughout Europe are accessible through that key. <span class="sources">(‘WC-Schlüssel’, n.d.)</span> </p>

          <p>While these initiatives are warmly welcomed, they do not address all relevant needs. For instance, conditions like urinary tract infections or other gynaecological issues are not taken into account. </p>

          <p>Some municipalities offer grants to businesses that open their toilets to the public. In London, the City’s Community Toilet Scheme encourages shops, restaurants, and bars to provide free access to their toilets during trading hours. <span class="sources">(‘Community Toilet Scheme (CTS)’, n.d.)</span> The <span class="bold">“Nette Toilette”</span> project in Germany and Switzerland operates on a similar principle, with municipalities paying around 28.000€ annually for 30 toilets, at 80€ per month per establishment. <span class="sources">(‘Die nette Toilette’, n.d.)</span> </p>

          <p>These initiatives highlight the ongoing need for accessible public toilets, which should be a responsibility of elected governments. Ensuring such facilities supports the broader concept of the right to the city, allowing individuals to change their environment in ways that reflect their needs and desires. </p>

          <p><span class="bold">“The right to the city is [...] far more than a right of individual access to the resources that the city embodies: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city more after our heart’s desire”</span> <span class="sources">(Harvey 2008)</span> </p>
